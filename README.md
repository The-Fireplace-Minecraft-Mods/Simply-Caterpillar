**Simply Caterpillar** adds a drill that makes 3x3 mineshafts for you. You can add or not add any part to customize your drill.

## Features

- Has unlimited possible caterpillar length.
- Doesn't require you to keep adding drill blades.
- Doesn't limit the number of components in each drill.

### Drill base

This is the drill base, it's used for all parts.

#### Recipe

### Drill head

The main part of the drill. Has 24 slots of storage built in, and a fuel slot. Power can be toggled in the gui, and fuel consumption will pause when the caterpillar is turned off.This is the drill head, its used to drill and has the inventory for the drill.

### Item Collector

Collects fallen items as it moves, and puts them in the caterpillar's inventory. Pretty useful if you don't want to manually pick up all blocks the drill breaks.

#### Recipe

### Decoration placer

Builds the inside of the mineshaft. By default, it is set up to make it resemble a vanilla mineshaft, but it is highly configurable. Again, configuration is done from the gui.

#### Screen

This is where you edit the decorations to be placed. By default, it places them similarly to the vanilla mineshafts.

#### Recipe

### Reinforcement placer

Replaces gravel/sand, lava, water, and air in the square surrounding the mineshaft with the block of your choice. The blocks can all be configured in the gui, as well as what gets replaced on each side.

#### Screen

<img src=".github/sources/screen-reinforcement.png" alt="Reinforcement placer screen" width="480" />

Edit the blocks used to reinforce the walls here and what gets replaced, so you can keep water, lava, sand, gravel, etc out of your mineshaft, or build yourself a floor to walk on, and walls and a ceiling if you wish.

#### Recipe

### Incinerator

Set anything you don't want to keep to be incinerated here. This allows you to destroy anything the caterpillar mines that you don't want, and save inventory space for what matters.

### Storage

Adds 12 more slots to the drill head's inventory.
